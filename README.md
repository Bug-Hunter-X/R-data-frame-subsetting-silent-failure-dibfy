# R Data Frame Subsetting Silent Failure

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in R's data frame subsetting mechanism. When using a character vector to specify column names for subsetting, if any of the specified names are not present in the data frame, the operation fails silently.  Instead of generating an error or warning, the subsetting simply omits the missing columns, which can lead to unexpected and difficult-to-debug behavior.

The `bug.r` file contains a simple code example that illustrates this problem. The `bugSolution.r` file provides a solution that uses more robust error handling to prevent silent failures.
